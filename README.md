# Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra

This repo contains solutions as well as notes for myself written using LaTeX for the course [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/).

It's been awhile since I touched linear algebra and have very little experience with LaTeX so I need a refresher.
